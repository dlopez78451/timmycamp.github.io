             <p>It’s important to start by washing your hands to prevent infection. If the wound is bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean bandage or cloth. Once the bleeding has stopped, the wound should be cleaned by rinsing it with clear water for 5 to 10 minutes and any dirt or debris should be removed with a tweezers cleaned with alcohol. After cleaning the wound, a thin layer of an antibiotic cream or ointment such as Neosporin or Polysporin should be applied. The wound should then be covered with a bandage to keep it clean. The dressing should be changed at least once a day or whenever the bandage becomes wet or dirty. Lastly, it’s crucial to watch for signs of infection. Even a minor cut can become infected so it’s important to respond quickly if you see redness, pus or swelling at the site of the injury.</p>

              <p>Before lighting a campfire, always check with local land managers to ensure there are no fire restrictions or bans in the area. Once the fire is lit, it should be maintained properly and extinguished completely when going to bed or leaving the area. This can be done by letting the campfire burn down to ashes and then pouring water on the fire to drown all embers, not just the red ones. After this, everything in the pit should be stirred with a shovel and tested for heat with the back of your hand. Once it is completely out, it is safe to go to bed or leave the area</p>

              <p>When camping, it's important to remember that you're sharing the environment with wildlife. Always be aware of your surroundings and the animals that may be present. Never feed wild animals, even small ones like squirrels or chipmunks, as this can attract predators. Keep your camping area clean, washing all cooking and eating utensils after use, and store leftover food in airtight containers. This helps to avoid attracting wildlife to your campsite. If you encounter wildlife, maintain a safe distance and resist the urge to take a selfie next to a wild animal. Remember, any wild animal will defend itself if it feels threatened. Also, report any wildlife attacks to the appropriate authorities. These measures help ensure both your safety and that of the wildlife.</p>
